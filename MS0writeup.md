In this milestone I focused on building and printing the Mini abstract syntax tree (AST). Using the provided MiniToASTVisitor, the parse tree from ANTLR is transformed into an AST with nodes such as Program, Function, Declaration, and Expression. I implemented PPASTVisitor to traverse this AST and pretty-print its structure: each node is labeled, children are indented one level, and leaves like identifiers or integers appear on a single line. This follows the basic guidelines for prettyprinting outlined in the assignment details.
